  --Every table has the following options:  
 --Tables (store data)
 --Views (virtual tables e.g. combining multiple tabeles)
 --Stored procedures 
 
 Each row is called a record
 We have customer id's so we can easily change customer info as necessary otherwise
 we'd have to make multiple changes if customer ordered multiple items
 
 Relational Tables - multiple tables that have a relationship or linked e.g. customers and 
 order_items
 
 Line, spaces and tabs are ignored, but best practice is putting each clause on a newline
